# Lung Cancer Detection using Machine Learning
If lung cancer is found at an earlier stage, when it is small and before it has spread, it is more likely to be treated successfully. Lung cancer screening is recommended for certain people who smoke or used to smoke, but who don't have any signs or symptoms. If a person has lung cancer but doesn't have any symptoms, this usually means there's a chance to detect the disease early.

The effectiveness of cancer prediction system helps the people to know their cancer risk with low cost and it also helps the people to take the appropriate decision based on their cancer risk status. The data is collected from the website online lung cancer prediction system.

Solution Details:
Since this is a Multi-Class Classification we have used Algorithms which are mainly used for Supervised Learning for the following Problem Statement.

Supervised Learning Algorithms:
Linear Regression
Support Vector Machine
K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier

The accuracy of all the above algorithms is as follows:-
The accuracy of the Linear Regression is: 95 %
The accuracy of the SVM is: 99 %
The accuracy of Decision Tree is: 98 %
The accuracy of KNN is: 98 %
